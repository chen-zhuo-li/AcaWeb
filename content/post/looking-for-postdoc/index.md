I guess it might be a bit early, but Iâ€™m starting to explore opportunities for a postdoc position. My background primarily lies in experimental mechanics, fracture mechanics, and soft materials. Beyond these areas, my research interests extend to biomechanics, biomedical devices, soft electronics, active materials, mechanical metamaterials, etc. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to connect if you feel interested!
