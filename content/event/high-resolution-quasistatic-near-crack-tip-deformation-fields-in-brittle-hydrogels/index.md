title: High-Resolution Quasistatic Near-Crack-Tip Deformation Fields in Brittle
  Hydrogels
abstract: At the tip of a propagating crack, the stress field becomes singular -
  and diverges to infinity. In reality, this divergent stress is regularized, as
  material failure occurs; furthermore, the nature of the singularity at the
  crack tip can be fundamentally altered by material nonlinearities before the
  onset of failure. Despite the importance of the crack tip in governing the
  failure of materials, experimental data that fully resolve the deformation
  near the crack tip are lacking, and experimental progress is hindered by the
  large deformation in soft materials such as hydrogels. Here, we propose a
  high-resolution method that resolves the near-tip deformation field based on
  direct measurement  of the deformation gradient tensor via a particle tracking
  algorithm. The particle tracking approach addresses shortcomings of large
  deformation/rotation scenarios near a free surface in existing deformation
  measurement methods. Using this method, we directly measured the displacement
  fields in the immediate vicinity of a quasistatic crack in a stretched
  polyacrylamide hydrogel. We furthermore quantify the error in our measurement
  of the components of the deformation gradient tensor, as developed from the
  particle displacement measurements. Using the deformation data, we determine
  the stress state with a neo-Hookean material model. These stresses are
  directly compared with classical LEFM theory and non-linear material model
  extensions to LEFM. Perspectives on employment of the method in 3D are
  provided.
