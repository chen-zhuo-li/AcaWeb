abstract: Rapid advances in biomedical applications and soft robotics demand
  load-bearing soft materials that can be processed into complex 3D shapes.
  Direct ink writing (DIW) enables the fabrication of customizable shapes with
  locally varying compositions. Hydrogels that are formulated as microgels meet
  the rheological requirements that DIW imparts on the inks if they are jammed.
  However, most granular hydrogels are soft because inter-particle interactions
  are weak. These hydrogels can be reinforced with a second hydrogel, yielding
  double network granular hydrogels (DNGHs). Yet, DNGHs suffer from low fracture
  energy. This limitation is addressed by electrostatically reinforcing them.
  The resulting materials exhibit Young's moduli and fracture energies similar
  to values of cartilage and muscles. An empirical model is proposed to predict
  the fracture energy of these reinforced DNGHs, based on the dissipation zone
  size, contact area, and adhesion energy. These DNGHs can be 3D-N, N-methylene
  bisacrylamideprinted into free-standing structures exhibiting tuneable
  mechanical properties at the centimeter scale without the need for supporting
  structures.
