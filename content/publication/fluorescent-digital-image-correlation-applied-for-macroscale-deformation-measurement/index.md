abstract: Fluorescent digital image correlation (DIC) has been implemented on
  monocular and binocular fluorescence microscopes for shape and deformation
  measurements at the microscale and even the nanoscale by tracking fluorescent
  particles. This technique, however, has not been used with regular optical
  imaging systems for DIC measurements at the macroscale so far. In this Letter,
  by combining the photoluminescence nature of fluorescent materials and
  bandpass filtering imaging, we discover that fluorescent DIC also features
  some distinct advantages in macroscale characterizations, e.g., specular
  reflection elimination, high speckle contrast, and the capability to
  simultaneously observe superficial/internal surfaces of transparent
  structures. To show these advantages and reveal the potential applications of
  fluorescent DIC, comparative experiments, including shape, displacement, and
  deformation measurements, were carried out. Furthermore, some issues
  accompanied by employing fluorescent imaging in DIC were discussed. This study
  indicates that upgrading classic DIC to fluorescent DIC can significantly
  improve its performance, enhance its functions, and expand its applications
  without introducing additional problems.
