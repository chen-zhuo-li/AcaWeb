abstract: An advanced two-dimensional digital image correlation (2D-DIC) using
  active imaging and telecentric imaging has been proposed to overcome the
  problems of out-of-plane motion and ambient light variation. Here, the
  technique is further improved by combining built-in coaxial illumination and
  telecentric fluorescent imaging to provide quality 2D-DIC measurement even in
  space-constrained scenarios. This improved 2D-DIC firstly excites the
  fluorescent speckles on the specimen surface using an ultraviolet light source
  through built-in coaxial illumination, and then employs a monochromatic
  telecentric imaging system to capture the images of the excited speckles. By
  tracking the movements of fluorescent speckles using DIC, full-field
  displacements and strains can be retrieved. For validation, the quality of
  speckle images captured by three different 2D-DIC systems was firstly
  evaluated, proving that the proposed fluorescent 2D-DIC can eliminate the
  specular reflections and acquire speckle images with the best quality. A
  uniaxial tensile test of an Al alloy specimen in an environmental chamber and
  thermal strain measurement of a polymethylmethacrylate sample in a water bath
  device were performed using the established system, further confirming the
  practicality of the proposed method. With the improved performance,
  compactness, and ease of use, this fluorescent 2D-DIC is expected to be widely
  applied in future research.
