abstract: Video extensometer assesses mechanical properties of materials by
  measuring their length changes under different loadings with combined use of
  video recording and image processing. In this Letter, an ultrasensitive video
  extensometer implemented on a single-camera dual field-of-view (dual FOV)
  telecentric imaging system is proposed. The method integrates the idea of FOV
  separation and telecentric imaging, which can increase the strain resolution
  with an order of magnitude and enhance the strain accuracy significantly.
  Validation experiments indicate that the root mean square error of a video
  extensometer was effectively decreased from 25.2 to 4.4 microstrains after
  employing the proposed method. Time-varying thermal strains of Al alloy and
  alumina ceramic samples were also precisely measured by the established
  ultrasensitive video extensometer, confirming its accuracy and practicality.
