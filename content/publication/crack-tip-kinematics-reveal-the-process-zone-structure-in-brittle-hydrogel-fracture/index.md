abstract: When brittle hydrogels fail, several mechanisms conspire to alter the
  state of stress near the tip of a crack, and it is challenging to identify
  which mechanism is dominant. In the fracture of brittle solids, a sufficient
  far-field stress results in the complete loss of structural strength as the
  material `unzipsâ€™ at the tip of a crack, where stresses are concentrated.
  Direct studies of the so-called small-scale yielding zone, where deformation
  is large, are sparing. Using hydrogels as a model brittle solid, we probe the
  small-scale yielding region with a combination of microscopy methods that
  resolve the kinematics of the deformation. A zone over which most of the
  energy is dissipated through the loss of cohesion is identified in the
  immediate surroundings of the crack tip. With direct measurements, we
  determine the scale and structure of process zone, and identify how the
  specific loss mechanisms in this hydrogel material might generalize for
  brittle material failure.
