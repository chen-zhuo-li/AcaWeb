abstract: Heatwave distortions, caused by unevenly distributed temperature and
  refractive index in the optical path, unavoidably occur in high-temperature
  digital image correlation (DIC) measurement. To eliminate these distortions, a
  multispectral DIC-aided reference sample compensation method is proposed. The
  proposed method first adheres a correcting transparent glass (decorated with
  fluorescent speckle patterns) onto the test specimen (sprayed with red speckle
  patterns). Then, by illuminating the specimen with ultraviolet- and red-light
  sources, the blue light excited from the correcting glass and the red light
  reflected from the specimen surface can be captured by a 3CCD camera, forming
  a color image. After separating the recorded color images into red and blue
  subimages, the original and the correcting displacement fields can be
  calculated from these two sets of subimages using the subset-based local
  2D-DIC algorithm. By point-to-point subtracting the correcting displacement
  fields from the original ones, the heatwave distortions can be eliminated, and
  the corrected real displacement fields can be obtained. For validation, static
  heatwave experiments show the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method
  in correcting heatwave distortions. A uniaxial tensile test of an aluminum
  specimen with a central hole was also performed, further confirming the
  practicality of the proposed method in correcting heatwave distortions and
  revealing heatwave-hidden deformation.
